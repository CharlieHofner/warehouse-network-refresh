Project Highlights
- Replaced all EOL Cisco 2960X switches with Catalyst 9200L-48P (5-member core stack + redundant IDF switches)
- Eliminated every single point of failure (warm spares, dual PSUs, 1500 VA APC UPS)
- Deployed two Arctic Wolf AWN202 MDR sensors in-line under the Palo Alto firewalls
- Decommissioned ancient plywood-mounted analog PBX → completed Vantage Unified cloud VoIP migration
- Turned decade-old rat’s-nest cabling into clean, labeled, service-friendly runs with proper lengths + Velcro
- Saved several thousand dollars through direct vendor negotiation
- Delivered 30–50% spare capacity for future expansion

Execution Timeline (Zero Production Impact)
- 8 weeks planning + triple port audits
- Thursday midday → secondary warehouse cutover in ~1 hour (validated with live RF-gun barcode scan)
- Friday night → pre-racked both main-warehouse IDF cabinets (scissor-lift, 500 ft apart)
- Saturday 8 am – 4 pm → core stack + final connections (Sunday contingency unused)
